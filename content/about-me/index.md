## Hello!

I am a software engineer based in Malaysia, where I am participate in coding, implementation, testing and support at Hitachi eBworx Sdn Bhd. 

I am optimistic and passionate as a software engineer, and try to write highly readable, maintainable and efficient code.


My favorite tools in programming are React where I used to create usable, component for user interface and Java where I used to create business logic using various Java EE such as Spring Boot.

This is where I write my thoughts about development, programming and whatever which interest me.

Have a nice day!

Regards.
